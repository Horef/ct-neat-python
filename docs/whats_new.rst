What's New
==========

What's new in ct-neat-python 1.0.1 (October 2025)
-------------------------------------------------
- Added an option for the dynamic attractors function to return the fingerprint in a form of a vector of floats,
instead of a string. This is needed for the Discretizer class which is currently in development.
- Started work on a Discretizer class which will be used to convert the continuous dynamics of CTRNNs into discrete states.
